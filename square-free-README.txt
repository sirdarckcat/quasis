About

The JavaScript shell was created by Jesse Ruderman. Ted Mielczarek added the tab completion feature in 1.1, Edward Lee added the multiline input feature in 1.2, and Jesper RÃ¸nn-Jensen fixed a few bugs for 1.4. Changelogs for some versions are available. The JavaScript Shell is GPL/LGPL/MPL tri-licensed.
